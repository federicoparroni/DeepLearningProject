%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
   The ABSTRACT should be self contained and explain what the paper is about. Usually abstracts are no longer than 300 words. You should state what are the main contributions of your work and tempt the reader to continue to read your paper. A good abstract briefly describes your problem, approach, and key results. This document is based on the CVPR submission template, and it has been adapted to submit a technical report of a project of the Deep Learning and Image Classification course.
\end{abstract}

\section*{Acknowledgements}
Here you can thank all the people that have been helpful during the project, but are not coauthors. It is important to add this section only in the final version that you send to the professors and \textbf{NOT in the review version} in order to not compromise the double blind review process. We thank Andrea Romanoni for the insightful comments during the review of the manuscript, and all the old and new Gods who stand beside us when the deadline is dark and full of terrors.
