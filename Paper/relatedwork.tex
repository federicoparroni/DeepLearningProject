\section{Related work}
In this section you should discuss published work that relates to your project. This is expected to be full of references, meaning that you have read the existing literature and you know what you are working on very well. This is not just a list or works, but you are not supposed to cluster papers that use similar approaches and compare them each other using very short sentences. I strongly suggest to check \cite{steinhardt, lipton} blog posts for some good practices in writing a paper. A quote that I like very much is \emph{``Research is spending 6 hours reading 35 papers, so you can write one sentence containing 2 references''} \cite{twit:ref}. Keep it in mind while you are writing!
